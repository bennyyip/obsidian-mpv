# Obsidian MPV

Open video clips in [mpv](https://mpv.io/) instead of the weak built-in player. It works for both edit mode and preview mode.

## Demo

## Tips

- Copy screenshot from video: [clipshot.lua](https://github.com/ObserverOfTime/mpv-scripts/blob/master/clipshot.lua)
- Copy video url with timestamp: [SmartCopyPaste.lua](https://github.com/Eisa01/mpv-scripts/blob/master/scripts/SmartCopyPaste.lua)

## TODO

- [ ] Online video timestamp
- [ ] Customize online video links(Now YouTube and Bilibili are hard coded)
- [ ] MPV IPC for Linux and MacOS

## Credit

Thank [media-extended](https://github.com/PKM-er/media-extended) for open url hooks. It's also the main inspiration of this project.
